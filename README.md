# 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio – Learning Path

Hi! 👋 I’m Syeda Anum Fatima, and this repository documents my journey of learning and practicing **Data Analysis** step by step.  
Each week, I work on real mini-projects to build practical skills in **Python, SQL, APIs, Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Power BI**.  

---

## 🚀 Weekly Projects

### ✅ Week 1: Web Scraping & APIs
- Scraped **1000 books** from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`
- Fetched **SpaceX launches** from the [SpaceX API](https://api.spacexdata.com/)
- Cleaned and exported datasets to CSV

### 🔜 Week 2: Data Cleaning & SQL
- Clean datasets (`books_all.csv` and `launches_2010_onwards.csv`) using `pandas`
- Perform analysis using SQL (joins, aggregations, window functions)
- Prepare cleaned datasets for visualization

---

### 🔜 Week 3: Power BI Dashboard
- Import cleaned data into Power BI
- Create interactive dashboards with KPIs & filters
- Share insights visually  

---

### 🔜 Week 4: Backend & Frontend Basics
- Build a mini **Flask API** to serve data
- Create a simple **HTML dashboard** that fetches data from the API  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, SQL, Power BI, HTML/CSS, Flask  
- **Libraries:** pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, json  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  

---

## 📈 Goal
By the end of this series, I will have a **complete data analyst portfolio** with end-to-end projects (scraping → cleaning → analysis → visualization → mini web app).
